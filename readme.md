The adoption of machine learning (ML) techniquesin industrial companies is characterized by an increasing numberof  use  cases  in  which  multiple  ML  software  components  areused,  with  new  ones  being  constantly  released.  Practitioners,  inparticular data scientists, face thus practical considerations whenbuilding  ML  systems,  which  go  beyond  the  known  challengesof  ML,  e. g.,  data  engineering  or  parameter  optimization.  Forinstance, practitioners are expected to quickly identify ML systemoptions  that  strike  a  suitable  balance  across  multiple  perfor-mance criteria. These options should also be understandable fornon-technical  users  to  be  accepted.  Addressing  these  practicalconsiderations  represents  a  problem  for  citizen  or  junior  datascientists,  with  limited  experience  or  domain  knowledge.  Thereis thus a need to help practitioners identify suitable ML softwarecombinations for industry use cases. AutoML systems address thisproblem  by  automating  the  ML  model  building  process  at  thecost  of  understandability.  In  this  paper  we  introduce  AssistML,a  multi-strategy  concept  to  recommend  ML  solutions,  i. e.,  MLsoftware  components  and  configurations  for  industry  use  cases.AssistML  uses  metadata  of  existing  ML  solutions  to  quicklyidentify and explain options for a new use case. The approach wasimplemented in an experimental prototype which was evaluatedwith  two  exemplary  use  cases.  The  results  show  that  AssistMLquickly provides recommendations with performance in line withthe practitionersâ€™ preferences or helps them identify the need fora  more  traditional  expert-driven  approach.
